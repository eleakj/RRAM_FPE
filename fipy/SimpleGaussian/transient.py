# Define an explicit form of the Fokker-Planck equation

# solving. The explicit form does not have this issue
# but it will have stability issues, giving rise to
# spurious oscillations in the result, which are
# numerical artifacts. Thus, we will solve the explicit
# form for a few initial time steps to get to a point
# that the implicit solver likes, and then switch over
# to the implicit solver to give the rest of the
# solution
